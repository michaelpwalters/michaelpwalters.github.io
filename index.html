						<h2>What I Do</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Michael is a Senior Financial Operations Analyst, currently working for <a href="https://andersen.com/">Andersen</a></li> in their Chicago office, who contributes to the decision making of senior management and is transitioning into a more strategic leadership role by becoming a CMA. A foundational attribute of his is lifelong learning both professionally and in his personal life. Once adverse to the thought of failing, he now knows taking calculated risks and growing through failure will deliver many opportunities for continued growth. Michael enjoys developing others and is often thanked for his patience. He believes in the traditional mentor/mentee relationship but also strongly believes it is necessary to have mentors who are younger than himself.</a><br /></a><br /> He has made great contributions within Chicago
					and the Central Region at Andersen by self-learning and implementing technology and analytics. By becoming familiar with SQL, he has in one circumstance improved efficiency more than 90%.</p>

						<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Michael holds a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Finance from <a href="https://wmich.edu/business/about/">Western Michigan University</a></li> and has completed some coursework in the Master of Legal Studies degree in Taxation from the University of San Francisco.</a><br /></a><br /> He is passionate about technology and languages. As a popular story of his motherâ€™s goes, he was once so frustrated with puzzles as a child he threw the pieces against a wall. Michael now not only loves doing puzzles with his son but also excels at any challenge whether a process improvement or learning a lingual or computer language. Originally from Southwest Michigan where he grew up loving the beauty of the great outdoors (watching deer, fox, turkey, and staring down a blue racer snake which matched his young height of three feet!) all in the backyard of his family home, he now lives in Chicago. He likes to get out and explore the city with his wife Megan and teach his son the traditional family values he was taught that will always lead to a successful life.</a><br /></a><br />He believes it best to focus inward contemplatively, expanding his mind, realizing the only actions we truly have any control over are our own as well as being mindful of the impact of our own decisions and habits on people we cannot see.</a><br /></a><br />Abroad, a favorite travel destination to date is Northern Spain. At home, cooking together is a relaxing family event he enjoys and as cat lovers his family hopes to add two cats to their home soon.</a><br /></a><br />If this page was accessed using a traditional domain, e.g. .com, it is also available as a blockchain website at michaelpwalters.crypto.
